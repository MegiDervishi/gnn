# Interaction Network for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics

This repo implements the network described in [1] in python using the multiprocessing library of python. The data to train the network is generated by the Physics_Engine.py 'gen' function. The physics engine models an n-body problem, we also started implementing a hard sphere model in the Physics_Engine_Hard_Spheres.py however it is still incomplete. The bulk of the project is in the interaction_network_parallel.py file, where we implement the class representing the interaction network and then train it by generating data in parallel and feeding it to the network to train it in a supervised manner. Running the code for 3h on a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of VRAM we managed to obtain the predicted behaviors presented in the 'results' folder. The weights obtained after training are also available in the 'weights' folder.
